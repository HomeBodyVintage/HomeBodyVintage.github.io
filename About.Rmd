<br>
<font size="4">Meet Adriana and Josh, owners of SLC Vintage Goods LLC.  
They have been restoring and selling vintage furniture to the Greater Salt Lake City area since 2020.<br>
Offering a curated selection of mid-century modern home goods, they focus on high-quality vintage <br> furniture ranging from the sleek lines of the 50-60's to curvy postmodern 80's design. <br> Their shop focuses on restoring vintage pieces to as close to their original design as possible.

Adriana is originally from Yucca Valley, CA and moved to Salt Lake City, UT in 2012 <br> to attend school at the University of Utah. After graduating in 2020 with a B.S. in Strategic Communications, <br> she started SLC Vintage Goods LLC and has been learning all things mid-century modern and honing her <br> design style. Adriana wants to lean on her experience in staging and interior decorating to pursue a career <br> in the interior design industry. 

Josh, a Wisconsin native, moved to Salt Lake City, UT in 2018 to pursue a M.S in Geophysics from the University of Utah. He graduated in 2020 and shortly thereafter began pursuing SLC Vintage Goods LLC full-time. Josh focuses on the restoration side of the business and spends most of his time trading in the stock market.
