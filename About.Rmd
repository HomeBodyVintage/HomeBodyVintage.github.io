<br>
<font size="4">Meet Adriana and Josh, owners of SLC Vintage Goods LLC. They have been restoring and selling vintage furniture to the Greater Salt Lake City area since 2020. Offering a curated selection of mid-century modern home goods, they focus on high-quality vintage furniture ranging from the sleek lines of the 50-60's to curvy postmodern 80's design. Their shop focuses on restoring vintage pieces to as close to their original design as possible.
<br>

Adriana is originally from Yucca Valley, CA and moved to Salt Lake City, UT in 2012 to attend school at the University of Utah. After graduating in 2020 with a B.S. in Strategic Communications, she started SLC Vintage Goods LLC and has been learning all things mid-century modern and honing her design style. Adriana wants to lean on her experience in staging and interior decorating to pursue a career in the interior design industry. 
<br>

Josh, a Wisconsin native, moved to Salt Lake City, UT in 2018 to pursue a M.S in Geophysics from the University of Utah. He graduated in 2020 and shortly thereafter began working on SLC Vintage Goods LLC full-time. Josh focuses on the restoration side of the business and spends much of his time trading in the stock market.
